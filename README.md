## Project Objectives

- **Scheduling Algorithm Implementation & Analysis**: We've implemented several scheduling strategies within a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) context. This process enhanced our understanding of how task prioritization impacts system responsiveness.

- **Communication & Synchronization**: The project delved into the intricacies of inter-task communication, examining and applying principles such as priority inversion and mutual exclusion to ensure synchronized operations.
